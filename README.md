## General Information
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate 
  loans through a fast online interface.
- You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a 
  decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    - .If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    - .If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to 
  risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which 
  are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
- loan.csv is Data set Used for project
- Loan_status is our target Variable for our project
